## **Dataset**

**Profanity Dataset**

The Profanity Dataset consists of positive and negative samples for text-based profanity detection. The positive dataset, containing profanity examples, was sourced from multiple repositories to ensure comprehensive coverage.

- Profanity List by dsojevic
- CMU Bad Words List
- List of Dirty, Naughty, Obscene Words from LDNOOBW
- Kaggle Profanities in English Collection

The dataset includes both positive samples (containing profanity) and negative samples (clean text) to train a binary classification model. Files are provided in the repository for training and evaluation purposes.


**Kissing Dataset**

The Kissing Scene Dataset was manually curated to ensure accuracy and relevance for video action recognition. The dataset consists of annotated video frames extracted from movie clips, with each video clip containing exactly 96 frames to maintain consistency.
Positive samples: Annotated frames where 15% of the frames depict explicit kissing scenes
Negative samples: Unannotated frames with no explicit romantic content

Annotation Process:
The dataset was manually annotated based on a clear definition of "kissing" action. However, several limitations may affect model performance:
Limited diversity in samples (demographics, contexts, angles)
Varying video quality across sources
Inconsistent lighting conditions
Cultural variations in romantic expressions
